### Project Scope

The game is a remake of the 1990 game Hatris using breakfast food instead of hats
The goal of the game is to stack 3 identical foods ontop of eachother in order to make
them disapear and score points. If the foods stack to high then the game is over. As the 
game is played and points are scored the block drop faster and faster until the game is 
lost. After the game is over the player sees their score as well as the high score, which
is stored in a text file. 

The graphics of the game are a grid that is printed to the screen when the screen is called
to update.
